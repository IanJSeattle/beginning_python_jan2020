Exercise A-1

Look in the examples/ directory, at gen_data.py and analyze_data.py.
Open each file, and try to understand what they do.  Try using comment
characters (# is the comment character in Python) to temporarily
disable parts of the program, and see what breaks.  The only danger
from running these programs is that if you have a file called
"data.csv" in the current directory, it will be overwritten when you
run gen_data.py.

If you can wrap your mind around how analyze_data.py works, try writing
a simple new function called print_stats() that prints out the
following statistics:

* mean (average) of all data points
* smallest data point
* largest data point

I recommend running a for loop over the data to collect these
statistics.

If this is too hard, that's ok!  This class introduced a whole lot of
new concepts all at once, and did not introduce everything necessary to
finish this exercise.  This definitely falls under "extra credit." :D
