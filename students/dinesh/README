Welcome to your personal directory.  This is your space to do any
experimenting you want to do in git, as well as check in exercise code.

Here's a quick cheat sheet on using git:

git status: Check the current status of your repo -- notably which
files are not checked in

git add <filename>: Add a filename to the git repo, when it's new,
or has been changed.

git commit: Commit changes to the repo.  If you run "git commit -m
<message>", it will take whatever appears after -m  as the commit
message -- enclose the message in quotes.  Use the -a option to
automatically add modified files.

git pull: Pull down changes from the repo on the server
