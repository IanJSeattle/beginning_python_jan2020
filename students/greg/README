Welcome to your personal directory.  This is your space to do any
experimenting you want to do in git, as well as check in exercise code.

Here's a quick cheat sheet on using git:

git status: Check the current status of your repo -- notably which
files are not checked in

git add <filename>: Add a filename to the git repo (only necessary when
a file is new)

git commit: Commit changes to the repo.  If you run "git commit -m
<message>", it will take whatever appears after -m  as the commit
message -- enclose the message in quotes.
