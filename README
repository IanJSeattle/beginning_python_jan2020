Welcome to the January 2020 Beginning Python class!

We will use this Git repo for many things in class.  Particularly, all
the HTML slide decks used in class are stored here, for your review.
You can find the exercise text here, and once an exercise is complete,
the answer key code.  You will add your code here.

To clone this repo, click the "Clone" button in the upper right hand
corner of the Gitlab window, and copy the text there, which starts with
"git clone".  Paste this into a terminal window, and when you run it,
it will copy all the files down to your computer.  Make sure you use
the "cd" command to change the current working directory to the place
you want to have your code -- I keep my programming files in a
directory called "devel", but you can do anything you like.  Just make
sure you can find it again.

We meet every Thursday at 2 PM Pacific time (5 pm Eastern time), at

In addition, we have office hours every Thursday at 11 am Pacific time,
which is a free-form time to bring problems or questions to discuss in
an informal environment.
